(banner here)

"Copy Translated" is a plugin for the FFXIV Dalamud modding framework that allows users to effortlessly copy in-game item names with just a single click from the context menu.

## Features 🌟

- **Multi-Language Support**: Great for users who have installed custom language packs in FFXIV. (and German/French players too, of course)
- **Convenience**: Especially beneficial for players who need to search for item info on websites in different languages. 
  - **Before**: Copy item name -> Google for item -> Paste translated name in the website (or marketboard)
  - **Now**: Skip Google entirely. Direct copy from the game.
